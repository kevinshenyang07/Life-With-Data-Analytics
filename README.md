# Notes and Projects

Hi, its kevin.

Data Science is huge yet fascinating, let's see how far we can go.

Never stop learning, get better everyday.

**Notes:**

The articles that I translated in my spare time.  I hope more people in China can know how data science is evolving all around the world.

[A Sneak Peek Into Optimizelyâ€™s First Industry Benchmark Report](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/notes/A%20Sneak%20Peek%20Into%20Optimizely%E2%80%99s%20First%20Industry%20Benchmark%20Report.pdf)

[Choose Boring Technology](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/notes/Choose%20Boring%20Technology.pdf)

[Creating a Data-Driven Organization- Two Years On](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/notes/Creating%20a%20Data-Driven%20Organization-%20Two%20Years%20On.pdf)

[CS183C-11-Technology-enabled Blitzscaling By Patrick Collison](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/notes/CS183C-11-Technology-enabled%20Blitzscaling.md)

**Projects:**

[Give Me Some Credit](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/projects/Give_Me_Some_Credit/Give_Me_Some_Credit.ipynb)

Use random forest and gradient boosting trees to predict serious delinquencies in next two years. Tuning parameters with grid search, reaching Kaggle bechmark with basically no feature engineering.

[Wells Fargo Text Analysis](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/tree/gh-pages/projects/Text_Anlysis_Wells_Fargo)

Use Clustering, Topic Model of LDA and Word2Vec to investigate relationships between topics and certain banks. I'm still working on an Watson Tone Analyzer API, but having some encoding problems.

[Geo-austin](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/tree/gh-pages/projects/Open_Street_Map_Austin)

Use BeautifulSoup to parse large file provided by Open Street Map into json, explore the data in MongoDB and finally visualize it with tableau.

[Define Data Analyst](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/tree/gh-pages/projects/Define_Data_Analyst)

Working on it...
