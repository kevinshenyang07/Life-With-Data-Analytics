# Notes and Projects

Hi, its kevin.

Data Science is huge yet fascinating, let's see how far we can go.

Never stop learning, get better everyday.

**Notes:**

The articles that I translated in my spare time.  I hope more people in China can know how data science is evolving all around the world.

[A Sneak Peek Into Optimizelyâ€™s First Industry Benchmark Report](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/notes/A%20Sneak%20Peek%20Into%20Optimizely%E2%80%99s%20First%20Industry%20Benchmark%20Report.pdf)

[Choose Boring Technology](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/notes/Choose%20Boring%20Technology.pdf)

[Creating a Data-Driven Organization- Two Years On](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/notes/Creating%20a%20Data-Driven%20Organization-%20Two%20Years%20On.pdf)

[CS183C-11-Technology-enabled Blitzscaling By Patrick Collison](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/notes/CS183C-11-Technology-enabled%20Blitzscaling.md)

**Projects:**

[Give Me Some Credit](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/tree/gh-pages/projects/Give_Me_Some_Credit/Give_Me_Some_Credit.ipynb)

Use random forest and gradient boosting trees to predict serious delinquencies in next two years. Parameters tuned by grid search cross-validation, followed by cost analysis. The model already reaches Kaggle bechmark with minimum feature engineering.

[Wells Fargo Text Analysis](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/blob/gh-pages/projects/Text_Anlysis_Wells_Fargo/Hashtags_TFIDF_KMeans_LDA_Word2Vec.ipynb)

Use clustering, topic model of LDA and Word2Vec to investigate relationships between topics and certain banks. The experimental Watson Tone Analyzer API is another option but there seems to be some problems returning the data.

[Geo-austin](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/tree/gh-pages/projects/Open_Street_Map_Austin)

Use BeautifulSoup to parse large XML file provided by Open Street Map into JSON, explore the data in MongoDB and visualize it with tableau.

[Prediction Service Demo](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/tree/gh-pages/projects/Prediction_Service_Demo)

Use flask and cherrypy to build a minimally viable web service, use spark and its mllib to process data and provide prediction.

[Define Data Analyst](https://github.com/kevinshenyang07/notes-and-projects/tree/gh-pages/projects/Define_Data_Analyst)

Use indeed API to get the metadata of positions with keyword "data analyst", get the contents of original job pages and build corpus based on the job description and requirements. Still in progress...
